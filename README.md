## Effective MLOps: Model Development

### Building an End-to-End Prototype: Steps
- Understanding the business model
- Formulating the Data Science problem
- Exploring and understanding the data
- Extablishing baseline metrics and models
- Communicating the results


### Case Study: 
- Autonomous Vechichles Perception

### Goal: 
- Detecting an object infront of a car base on a camera image (Semantic Segmentation)

### Dataset Description:
- Semantic Segmentation on BDD100K dataset is one of the tasks making up a large self driving system which may include 
prediction,motion planning and more subtasks.
